# Project Title

## 1. Project Description

Our team, BBY#03, has developed a hospital wait time application to assist the people in Metro Vancouver in reducing wait times in emergency rooms. The application provides live updates on wait times and guides users to the appropriate hospital. Users can locate and view the wait times of each emergency room in Metro Vancouver. Our app retrieves information about the user's current location and calculates the distance to the nearest hospital using longitude and latitude coordinates. Wait times are categorized based on time periods. The wait time displayed in Navigation 1 represents the average wait time at the current hospital for that specific time. Average wait times are derived from user input. If a user enters the hospital's radius, our app prompts them to confirm their location. If they leave the radius, the app prompts them to confirm their departure, allowing us to calculate the duration of their stay. Additionally, users can submit time reviews for each hospital.
